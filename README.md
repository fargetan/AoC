## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code (TM) is a programming challenge by that begins every year at midnight on December 1st, EST (UTC-5). Each day, a two part challenge appears. Aside from the worldwide leaderboard where people compete against everybody to be one of the first to solve the challenges, you can create a private leaderboard to compete amongst your friends, coworkers, etc. Before looking any further into this repo, please visit the [website](https://adventofcode.com).

## About this repo
In this repository you will find directories with the code I used to solve some of the daily challenges and the input I was provided. Full disclosure, I am not a professional programmer, so my solutions are very likely to be ineffiecient and buggy. If you are interested in providing input on my solutions or perhaps providing your own solution, especially for the challenges I have not solved or solutions in a different programming language, feel free to send me a message or fork the repo and send a pull request.

The top level contains directories for the year, then for each year there will be a directory for each day of the challenge. Within each day you may find the input I received (which is not necessarily the same as the input you would receive on the website) along with the code I used and potentially some test input for debugging/testing the code as I went. Due to my own inconsistency, sometimes the input is in a separate text file, and some of the input is actually in the python script itself. Often this will be the example that the website provides for that day.

Thanks and have fun!

Nathan
